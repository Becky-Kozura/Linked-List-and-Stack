# Linked-List-and-Stack
## Projects 4 and 5 from CSC6301, implementing Linked List and Stack
### This project is an imprementation of a Linked List and Stack. It uses the LinkedList class and the Stack class from the Java Collections framework to demonstrate code reuse. It also takes user input from the java.utils Scanner class.
### This project is useful to demonstrate code reuse and how to use classes from Java Collections. 
### Users can use this project as a pattern to experiment with other data structures and code reuse. 
### To get started, users can use the javadocs to get information about how to run and how the program works.
### This project was created by Becky Kozura in Weeks 4-5 of the CSC6301 class in Merrimack College's Master's Degree of Computer Science program.
